We are writing in reaction the recent announcement of the creation of the National fMRI Data Center (www.fmridc.org). In the letter announcing the creation of the center, it was also implied that leading journals in our field may require authors of all fMRI related papers accepted for publication to submit all experimental data pertaining to their paper to the Data Center. … We are particularly concerned with any journal’s decision to require all authors of all fMRI related papers accepted for publication to submit all experimental data pertaining to their paper to the Data Center."
