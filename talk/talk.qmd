## Why neuroimaging is a best-case scenario for open science
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
<div style="font-size: 1.25em;">
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the primary tool for studying human brain structure and function
- MRI data are digital end-to-end
    - From MRI scanner to automated analysis
    - Usually zero/few manual analysis steps
- The field has largely converged on:
  - a standardized image format (NiFTI)
  - a ~common spatial coordinate system

This letter comes from a group of scientists who are publishing papers using fMRI to understand the links between brain and behavior\. We are writing in reaction the recent announcement of the creation of the National fMRI Data Center \(www\.fmridc\.org\)\. In the letter announcing the creation of the center\, it was also implied that leading journals in our field may require authors of all fMRI related papers accepted for publication to submit all experimental data pertaining to their paper to the Data Center\.
…
We are particularly concerned with any journal's decision to require all authors of all fMRI related papers accepted for publication to submit all experimental data pertaining to their paper to the Data Center\.

## 2010: The year data sharing broke in neuroimaging

![](./images/biswal_title.png)
![](./images/biswal_date.png)

- "Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation to discern geneticinfluences and brain–behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability. ..."

## Example of OpenNeuro reuse

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- A challenge for decoding brain activity from fMRI data is that most datasets are very small
- We used OpenNeuro to train a "foundation model"
  - A pre-trained model that can be used as a starting point for decoding models on smaller datasets
- We pre-train models on broad fMRI data from OpenNeuro: 11,980 experimental runs from 1,726 individuals across 34 datasets.

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](./images/thomas_results.png)

- This approach substantially increased decoding performance vs. a baseline model

## Challenges to open sharing

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- All OpenNeuro MRI datasets must be *defaced*
  - To reduce risk of reidentification
- There is increasing risk that subjects might be reidentified even after defacing using advanced face recognition systems + face imputation tools (Schwartz et al., 2021)
- If the risk continues to rise, it may become necessary to move away from open sharing
  - This would be a huge loss for researchers, research participants, and the world
- We have proposed regulatory changes to protect subjects from misuse of neuroscience information in the US context (Jwa & Poldrack, 2022, *J. Law & Biosciences*)

## Keys to success in neuroimaging data sharing

<div style='font-size: 1.2em'>
- *Data are digital end-to-end*
  - Minimizes manual steps in the process
- *Standardized file formats and data standards*
  - Makes data immediately usable by anyone
  - Reduces burden of curation and preparation
- *Demonstrated scientific utility*
- *Numerous success stories*
</div>

## Lessons learned

<div style='font-size: 1.2em'>
- Community buy-in is essential
  - Mandates put in place before the community is ready can backfire
    - Unless they have overwhelmingly powerful advocates, as in genomics
  - Important that sharing advocates are members of community and eat their own dog food
</div>

## Lessons learned

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
<div style='font-size: 1.2em'>
- Keep it simple and as close to standard practice as possible
  - Overengineered solutions have generally failed
  - If there are more than 2 acronyms…
